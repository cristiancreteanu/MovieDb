A C++ program that simulates a movie database. 

main.cpp is the file that contains the methods which parse the query string and call the necessary function accordingly.

imdb.cpp is the file which contains the methods that interract with the database for queries such as: 
      add movie/user/actor
      add/update/remove/get rating
      get longest career actor
      get most influential director (based on the number of actor they have worked with)
      get best year for category (the year that has the best ratings for the specified category)
      get 2nd degree colleagues (the second degree colleagues of an actor X are those that have not worked directly with X, but with actors that X has worked with)
      get top k most recent movies
      get top k actor pairs
      get top k partners for actor
      get top k most popular movies
      get average rating in range (of years)
      
I have included several tests in order to show that the program works. Run the check.sh script
